# Jellylist
#### (formerly GetLink)
Web server that creates M3U files for TV shows on a Jellyfin instance.

## Setup
*These instructions only work for Windows 10/Server 2016 or later. I haven't tested Linux or macOS yet, but builds are available. I haven't used any Windows-specific features, so it should be fine as long as you have .NET 7 installed. Windows 8.1/Server 2012 R2 or earlier is not supported (rip windows 7).*
1. Download the latest release.
2. Put the folder somewhere safe.
3. Open up a terminal in that area.
4. Type in `Jellylist.exe --urls http://localhost:[port] --publicUrl [URL to Jellyfin instance]`
5. Test it out by getting a series ID from your web browser (ex: `[...]/web/index.html#!/details?id=[series id]&context=tvshows&serverId=[...]`), then open this in VLC: `http://localhost:[port]/GetM3U?seriesId=[series id]&username=[username]&password=[password]` OR `&authToken=[api key]` (if you put in both username, password, and auth token, the auth token takes priority)

If you want to mass download an entire season with a program like Free Download Manager, you can add "&returnType=txt" to the end, removing all metadata other than download links.

You don't have to be a manager of the instance for this to work, but your account needs to have download permissions.
